Making the Project

* THE BASICS

Backend:

- install backend packages
- setup server with express
  + create user schema

- connect to MongoDB 
  + make new database on site
  + add connection string

- setup GraphQL on backend

Frontend:

- install packages
- setup webpack config
- create skeleton app in entry file

* NEXT STEPS:

Backend:
- add CORS

Frontend:
- setup GraphQL with Apollo
- Flesh out Components + Routes (Protect some routes)

Fullstack:

  + use Node package like Passport
    * Use strategy for JWT or Session Token

Future improvements:
- design frontend for mobile browsers
- add real styling
- add redux for scaling to full-sized app
- add testing
- abstract private frontend routing logic into PrivateRoute component
- wrap jsx in SessionForm in a form tag to get submit behavior out of the box
- switch JWT storage from localStorage to cookie (+ setup CSRF protection) to prevent XSS attacks
